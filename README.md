Final Project - Interactive Data Visualization  
===
Kendall Haddigan, Andrew Sosa, Nicholas Whalen
Description
---
The Index.html file and the style.css file are our code for the project. We have also added our process book to the github in pdf format.
We used the d3 library which is implemented in the index.html file and the dataset we used is in csv format titled InternetUsagePop.csv.
Both the github pages link to our website and the screencast video are linked below. The slider is used to change the data from year
to year, the button that says "Process Book" redirects you to our Google document process book and our screencast YouTube video is 
linked to the website as well. The map can be hovered over to see the datapoints of each country and is displayed on the bottom left of the screen.
