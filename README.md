-Bing copilot helped out with some errors(Like the one mentioned above) and documentation questions about d3 specifically about the brush. Along with some mundane task to save time like creating all the slots for mapping the colors of each different value of all the attributes. It also helped out with some ways to style.


##### I believe this is everything but feel free to reach out if you have questions.
