# Description
The goal of this project is to provide an exploratory interface that allows user's to see how the emission of 
greenhouse gases in the United States and the rest of the world has changed over the last decade. When greenhouse gases 
are emitted into our atmosphere, they trap the sun's heat, leading to global warming and climate change. We feel that it 
is important for our readers to understand where the highest concentrations of these gases have been coming from.

# Code Description
All the code for our website can be found in index.html. We did not use any libraries other than d3 to complete this 
project. Other folders within the repo contain the process book, materials for the process book, extra  materials used
within the code, and our data sources. 

# Special Features
There are a couple features within our visualization that may not be obvious. Within the first graph, you can hover over
the circle on the graph to read more information about that point on the graph. Within the treemap, you can hover over
each of the rectangles and get a tool tip with information about the country. In the area graphs, you can hover over 
each one and get information about that specific greenhouse gas. Finally, for the map section of the visualization, you 
can select one or multiple years to see how the data effects just one or a span of years. 

# References
To complete this project we used the help of Data Is Plural, United Sates Environmental Protection Agency, ChatGPT, 
European Environment Agency, and NASA. These resources both gave us the data we needed to create our visualizations and 
any coding help we needed to produce them.
