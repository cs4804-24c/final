### Information

Utilizing a global dataset created to document the illegal trade and seizure of cheetahs between the years 2010 and 2019, this visualization aims to summarize the data from these incidents in an interactive way. Our group implemented a filterable and sortable horizontal bar chart with the goal of showing the number of cheetahs involved in incidents, organized by location (specifically the country).


The code for the website and visualization can be found in index.html. The /data folder contains both the original .xlsx file from the dataset source, as well as the modified and cleaned .csv file we utilized to create our visualization. The entirety of the visualization was made using d3.js.
