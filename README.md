Overview
---
### Non-obvious Features
When the initial investment value is typed in and calculated, the market value updates itself everytime a new historical period is selected. 

### Files
* index.html & script.js: These two files contain the essential part of the visualization. The script.js is from a stock price visualization template with basic functions, and extra features are built on top of it, including the stock price tooltip, historical area selection, and market value calculation. 
* styles.css: It was created to polish the overall style, mostly done with the help of the ChatGPT.
